This project is a **Smart Curtain System** designed using **logic gates (AND, OR, NOR, NOT)**, switches, resistors, and an **LDR sensor**. It automates curtain control based on **light intensity** and **user inputs**.

---

## ⚙️ Project Description

The system is built using basic logic gates to simulate an automatic curtain that responds to both **ambient light** and **manual override controls**.

### 🔌 Main Inputs

- **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)**: Detects ambient light intensity.  
- **LC (Local Control)**: Manual curtain control via switch.  
- **SO (System Override)**: Forces curtain to open or close, overriding automatic behavior.  
- **SC (Set Control)**: Additional control signal input.

### ⚙️ Logic Processing

- Implemented using **AND, OR, NOR, and NOT gates** from **7400 series TTL ICs**.  
- Final output connected to an **LED** to indicate system status or errors.

## 🖥️ Simulation & PCB

- ✅ Circuit simulated using **Proteus**.  
- ✅ **PCB layout** created with clearly labeled inputs and outputs.  
- ✅ Fully implemented using **TTL logic ICs (7400 series)** — *no microcontroller used*.
